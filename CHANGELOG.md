# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Changelog Best Practices

### General Principles

- Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
- Include an entry for every version, with the latest first.
- Group similar changes under: Added, Changed, Improved, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Documentation, Performance, CI.
- **"Test" is NOT a valid changelog category** - tests should be mentioned within the related feature or fix entry, not as standalone entries.
- Use an "Unreleased" section for upcoming changes.
- Follow Semantic Versioning where possible.
- Use ISO 8601 date format: YYYY-MM-DD.
- Avoid dumping raw git logs; summarize notable changes clearly.

### Guidelines for Contributors

All contributors (including maintainers) should update `CHANGELOG.md` when creating PRs:

1. **Add entries to the `[Unreleased]` section** - Add your changes under the appropriate category (Added, Changed, Improved, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Documentation, Performance, CI)
2. **Follow the changelog format** - See examples below for detailed guidelines
3. **Group related changes** - Similar changes should be grouped together
4. **Be descriptive** - Write clear, user-focused descriptions of what changed
5. **Mention tests when relevant** - Tests should be mentioned within the related feature or fix entry, not as standalone entries

**Example:**

```markdown
