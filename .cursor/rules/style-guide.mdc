# Style Guide

Follow **docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md** for code and UI conventions.

- **Code**: TypeScript, React, file naming (PascalCase components, camelCase hooks), directories, best practices.
- **Styling**: Tailwind only (no .module.css). Class order: Layout → Typography → Visual → Interactive → States. Use the doc’s common patterns (overlay, popup, buttons, etc.).
